## 👋 About

This repository is the **central dashboard** for my transition into AI Engineering. It is *not* a
code dump — application code lives in dedicated [project repositories](#-project-portfolio). This
repo holds the **map, the notes, and the proof of progress**.

- **Background:** Experienced software engineer, going deep on LLMs & applied AI.
- **Goal:** Become a production-ready AI Engineer and clear interviews at top product companies and
  AI startups.
- **Approach:** Learn by building. Every concept is reinforced with a hands-on, portfolio-quality
  project. Every milestone ends with interview preparation.
- **Timeline:** ~6 months, ~20 hrs/week (started June 2026).
