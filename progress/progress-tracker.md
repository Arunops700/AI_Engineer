## Milestone 1 checklist

- [x] Learning notes written (`notes/llm-fundamentals.md`, `notes/llm-apis-tool-use.md`)
- [x] Exercises drafted (`exercises/milestone-1-llm-fundamentals.md`)
- [x] `structured-extractor` built: typed, tested (ruff/mypy/pytest green), documented, Dockerized, CI
- [x] Interview Q&A added (project `docs/interview-questions.md` + master `interview-prep/`)
- [ ] Add live API keys to a local `.env` and run an end-to-end extraction
- [x] Milestone 1 reviewed & approved → start Milestone 2 (RAG)

## Milestone 2 checklist

- [x] `rag-knowledge-assistant` built: hybrid retrieval + RRF, rerank hook, cited answers, eval harness
- [x] Runs zero-infra (offline embedder + fake answerer); pgvector backend + docker-compose provided
- [x] Quality green (ruff/mypy/pytest — 18 tests) + CI + Docker; portfolio docs + interview Q&A
- [ ] (Optional) Add keys / start pgvector to run semantic embeddings + real answers end-to-end
- [x] Milestone 2 reviewed & approved → start Milestone 3 (Agents & MCP)

## Milestone 3 checklist
